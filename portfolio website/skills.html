<div class="HTML">
    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">HTML/CSS</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;">HTML and CSS form the essential foundation of web development, allowing me to create structured, visually appealing, and responsive websites. HTML builds the content and layout, while CSS adds design, color, spacing, animations, and overall styling. Learning both helps me transform ideas into functional web pages that work on different devices. These skills enable me to create professional, user-friendly interfaces and understand how modern websites are designed and built from the ground up.</p><br><br>

    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">JavaScript</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;">JavaScript brings websites to life by adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and real-time functionality. With JavaScript, I can create animations, validate forms, build sliders, develop menus, and interact with APIs. It allows web pages to respond instantly to users, making the experience smoother and more engaging. Understanding JavaScript strengthens my problem-solving skills and prepares me for advanced frameworks. It is a crucial skill for modern web development and essential for building interactive digital applications effectively.</p><br><br>

    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">Python</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;">Python is a simple yet powerful programming language that helps me understand fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditions, and functions. Its clean syntax makes it great for beginners while still being widely used in data science, automation, AI, and backend development. Learning Python strengthens my logic-building skills and helps me think through problems more clearly. Even at a basic level, Python allows me to create small programs, automate tasks, and explore more advanced technologies later.</p><br><br>

    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">Git & GitHub</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;">Git and GitHub help me manage code efficiently by tracking changes, preventing mistakes, and enabling teamwork on projects. Git stores version history, allowing me to undo errors or review earlier work, while GitHub provides a cloud platform for hosting repositories and collaborating with others. Using these tools improves organization, workflow, and professionalism. They are essential skills for any developer, helping me showcase projects, contribute to group work, and build confidence in managing code properly.</p><br><br>

    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">UI/UX Basics</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;">UI/UX design focuses on creating digital experiences that are visually appealing, easy to use, and enjoyable for users. UI deals with the look and feel of an interface, while UX focuses on how smoothly users interact with it. Learning UI/UX basics helps me design layouts, choose colors, apply spacing, and understand user behavior. These principles guide me in building websites and applications that are not only functional but also comfortable, intuitive, and satisfying to use.</p><br><br>

    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">Java</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;">Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used in application development, backend systems, and Android apps. Learning Java teaches strong programming principles like classes, objects, inheritance, and data structures. Its stable performance and wide use in enterprise environments make it valuable for future opportunities. With Java, I can build desktop programs, simple games, and mobile applications. Understanding Java strengthens my overall logic, problem-solving skills, and prepares me for more advanced software development challenges.</p><br><br>
